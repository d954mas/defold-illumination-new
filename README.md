# Illumination

## Overview

Mix of [defold-illumination](https://github.com/astrochili/defold-illumination) and [defold-light-and-shadows](https://github.com/Dragosha/defold-light-and-shadows)
This extension contains ready-to-use forward shading lighting mixed with realtime shadow from one source (the sun)

**Cons:**

1. Worked in mobile( defold-illumination not worked in my mobile looks like shader precision problem)
2. Frustum culling to light sources(from [scene3d](https://github.com/indiesoftby/defold-scene3d))

**TODO:**

1. [Clustered forward shading](https://github.com/astrochili/defold-illumination/issues/1)
2. Dynamic shadow matrix(update the shadow matrix whenever the camera moves so that it ideally describes the camera's frustum)
